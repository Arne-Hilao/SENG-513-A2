GAME:       Chess

PLATFORM:   Desktop

GENRE:      Strategy

OBJECTIVE:  Maneuver the pieces so that the opponent's king is in check (a piece is threatening to capture it) with no moves to either move the king to a piece not being threatened by a different piece, or no piece that can be interposed to stop the piece from threatening the king.

RULES:      - Players take their turns (starting with white) to move their pieces.
            - Players can capture pieces according the the pieces capturing rules, which are usually moving the piece normally at the piece they are looking to capture (except pawns, which capture diagonally)
            - A king is put in check, when an opposing piece is threatening to capture it with the next move. When in check, the player's only legal move is to move the king away, or interpose a different piece in front of the king.
            - A player wins when the opposing king is in checkmate, where the king is placed in check with no way to move the king to safety, or interpose a different piece in front of the king.
            - A player also wins when their opponent is the active player, and presses the resign button
            - A player can also win when the opponents timer runs out (if playing with the timer)
            - The players can draw when the game goes into stalemate. That is, when the king is not in check, but no other moves can be played.
            - It can also end in a draw when the draw button is clicked, and then confirmed.
            - It can also happens when there are only two kings

MECHANICS:  Players take turns to move their pieces. They may play without a timer, pressing play on the timer at the top of the screen, or without one. Players must first click the piece they wish to move, which will highlight the legal moves, and then click on one of the highlighted squares to move the piece there. Clicking on the piece selected, or clicking on a different piece cancels the selection.
